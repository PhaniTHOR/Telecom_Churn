# Predicting which customers are at high risk of churn

## Problem Statement

One of the major challenges faced by telecom companies is customer churn, which is the loss of customers to competitors. Customer churn is costly for telcos, as they have to spend more money on acquiring new customers than retaining existing ones. Moreover, customer churn reduces the profitability and loyalty of telcos. Therefore, telcos need to identify the customers who are at risk of churning and take proactive actions to prevent them from leaving. This can be done by using data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict customer churn and offer personalized incentives and services to retain them.


## Data Description

Each row represents a customer, each column contains customer’s attributes described on the column Metadata.

The data set includes information about:

1) Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
    
2) Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
    
3) Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
    
4) Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
